							<h1>VeritablAI</h1>
							<p>Misinformation is abundant on the Internet, and many political campaigns utilize it for their benefit,
								which is damaging to people's lives and interpersonal relationships. This is where our product, 
								VeritablAI, comes in. It analyzes speech from a person and checks it against a Wikipedia database to
								determine if their talking points are scientifically accurate. Then, in real time, a banner for how
								truthful the assertion is will constantly update, depending on its accuracy. That way, for instance,
								viewers at home can determine if a politician is distorting facts if this were to be deployed on a TV
								show. </p>
							<p>Most of our code was done in Python. We used FastAPI for our web server, Vultr to store our data and
								run some of our code constantly, Snowflake API's LLM capabilities to parse recorded audio, and Google
								Gemini to compare the audio sample with cached Wikipedia pages for accuracy.

							<h2>What we do</h2>
							<p>We have participated in four UMass hackathons thus far, designing projects ranging from RPG games to
								innovations of useful AI tools that transform the world around us. We have combined our knowledge of
								programming and physics, as well as our willingness to learn new frameworks to efficiently design
								projects within approximately 30 hours. Two of our selected projects are shown below:</p>
							<div class="features">

									<span class="icon solid major fa-code"></span>
									<h3><a href="https://galaxai.wiki">GalaxAI</a></h3>
									<p>Our previous project that used machine-learning algorithms that analyze spectroscopy data for detecting
										the presence of black holes. It won two awards at Hack(h)er 413 last year.

									<h3><a href="https://devpost.com/software/dawg-a8q2dg">DAWG</a></h3>
									<p>Not an AI tool, but it was a helpful concept of a robotic companion that can help hospital patients with
										mobility challenges. It would move around with an internal gyroscope, supporting sufficient weight
										for small objects. </p>
